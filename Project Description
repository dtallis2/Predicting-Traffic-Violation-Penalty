The county of Montgomery, Maryland keeps a daily updated record of all issued electronic traffic violations within the county. The dataset includes information about the nature of the violation, the description of the car and driver, the time and location, and the classification of the penalty. The penalties include: warnings, citations, safety equipment repair orders (SERO), and arrests. 
Building a model to predict traffic violation penalties can identify the factors that contribute to violations that end in more significant penalties. Additionally, predicting violations based on objective factors, as opposed to personal factors like race or gender, can help reduce human bias in penalty assignment, making law enforcement practices more fair and transparent. Lastly, the model could be used to train new police officers by giving them the information about a traffic violation and comparing the violation type they would assign with what their coworkers typically did.
